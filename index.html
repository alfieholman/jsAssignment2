        <h2>Characteristics of javascript</h2>
        <p>javascript is a event driven programing language it uses a just in time compiler and is used in things such as websites, games and mobile applications. In javascript there is something called a object this refers to a set of data that is linked together for example if a person was a object the data would be their name, hight, weight, date of birth and other similar data all of this data comes together to for a object in this case it would be a person. with a object you can add new data or preform a action on it when these functions are stored inside a objects properties it is known as a method. when something happens in HTML it is know as a event these are thing such as pressing a button or loading a image when these events happen javascript can be ran alongside the HTML code to allow the event to do different things such as having a window closed when a button is pressed or having the dat displayed. Javascript is good but it does have some security issues such as unintended script execution this is when a user manages enter script into a javascript program when they aren't intended to this can sometimes be done through text boxes the script can allow them to access information or privileges that they shouldn't be able to get another big security issue is source code vulnerabilities as the source code for website is visible a potential hacker could study the code and find a flaw within it leading to a hack or issue and as javascript is just in time compiled the source code is required to allow the website to run and this can lead to issues like this </p>
