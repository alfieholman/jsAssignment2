        <h2>Characteristics of javascript</h2>
        <p>javascript is a event driven programing language it uses a just in time compiler and is used in things such as websites, games and mobile applications. In javascript there is something called a object this refers to a set of data that is linked together for example if a person was a object the data would be their name, hight, weight, date of birth and other similar data all of this data comes together to for a object in this case it would be a person. with a object you can add new data or preform a action on it when these functions are stored inside a objects properties it is known as a method. when something happens in HTML it is know as a event these are thing such as pressing a button or loading a image when these events happen javascript can be ran alongside the HTML code to allow the event to do different things such as having a window closed when a button is pressed or having the dat displayed. Javascript is good but it does have some security issues such as unintended script execution this is when a user manages enter script into a javascript program when they aren't intended to this can sometimes be done through text boxes the script can allow them to access information or privileges that they shouldn't be able to get another big security issue is source code vulnerabilities as the source code for website is visible a potential hacker could study the code and find a flaw within it leading to a hack or issue and as javascript is just in time compiled the source code is required to allow the website to run and this can lead to issues like this </p>

        <button onclick="useralert()">alert</button>
        <button onclick="userconfirm()">confirm</button>
        <button onclick="userpromptboxes()">prompt box</button>
        <p></p>
        <p>please enter a number between 15 and 30</p>
        <input id="valid">
        <button onclick="validation()">validate number</button>
        <p id="numcheck"></p>

        <script>
            function redirect()
            {
                location.replace("page redirect.html")
            }
            function useralert()
            {
                alert("this is a alert")
            }
            function userconfirm()
            {
                confirm("this is a confirm box")
            }
            function userpromptboxes()
            {
                var person = prompt("please enter the date"); 
            }
            function validation()
            {
                var response,x

                x = document.getElementById("valid").value;

                if ( x > 1 && x < 10)
                    {
                        response="good";
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        response="bad"
                    }
                document.getElementById("numcheck").innerHTML = response
            }
        </script>
        <p></p>
        <p>there are many issues with client side scripting which can lead to issues depending on what browser you like to use a example of code running differently on different browser is bellow</p>
        <p id="example"></p>
        <script>
            var b = [1, 2, 3,]
            document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = b
        </script>
        <p>if you try and open the website in internet explorer then 1,2,3 will not appear but if you open it in chrome or safari then it will appear this is because it depends on what implementation of javascript the browser is built with also it can change depending on the browser engine and internet explorer is quite old meaning it was built with a older version of javascript as well as a older engine which have some bugs like above and more modern browsers have implemented fixes for these issues one simple fix for the issue above to make it appear on all browsers is by removing the comma at the end of the number list</p>

        <p>the image above is the problematic code</p>
        <img src="Annotation 2021-04-17 020348.png">
        <p>and the image above is the fix that will allow it to appear on all browsers bellow is the proof</p>
        <p id="proof"></p>
        <script>
            var a = [1, 2, 3]
            document.getElementById("proof").innerHTML = a
